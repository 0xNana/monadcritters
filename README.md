# MonadCritters üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

MonadCritters is an exciting blockchain-based racing game where players can mint, collect, and race unique creatures called Critters in competitive races to win rewards.

## Overview

MonadCritters combines NFT collecting with competitive racing mechanics. Each Critter is a unique NFT with special racing attributes that determine their performance in races.

### Key Features

- **Mint Unique Critters**: Each Critter is an NFT with unique stats:
  - Speed: Determines base racing speed
  - Stamina: Affects race endurance
  - Luck: Influences race variance and outcomes
  - Rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Legendary (with multipliers)

- **Multiple Race Types**:
  - Two Player Races
  - Five Player Races
  - Ten Player Races
  Each with different entry fees and reward structures

- **Power-Up System**:
  - Speed Boosts: Enhance your Critter's performance
  - Strategic power-up usage with diminishing returns
  - Power-ups cost 10% of race entry fee

- **Reward System**:
  - Prize pools from entry fees
  - Multiple winners based on race type
  - Performance-based reward distribution
  - Leaderboard tracking

### Game Mechanics

#### Racing
- Races are skill-based competitions where Critters compete based on their stats
- Race outcomes are determined by:
  - Base Critter stats (Speed, Stamina, Luck)
  - Rarity multipliers (1.0x - 1.5x)
  - Strategic power-up usage
  - Luck-based variance

#### Scoring System
- Speed has the highest weight (1.2x)
- Stamina has standard weight (1.0x)
- Luck has lower weight (0.8x) but adds variance
- Rarity multipliers boost overall performance
- Power-ups provide diminishing returns:
  - First boost: 20% increase
  - Second boost: Additional 15% increase

## Wallet Connection Information

### Supported Wallet Types

Currently, MonadCritters supports the following wallet connection methods:

- MetaMask
- Other injected wallets (Brave, etc.)
- WalletConnect (for supported chains)

### Known Limitations

**Social/Email Logins**: Social and email logins are currently disabled because WalletConnect's Cloud infrastructure does not yet officially support Monad testnet (chainId 10143). This is a limitation of the WalletConnect platform, not of the MonadCritters application.

When WalletConnect adds official support for Monad testnet, we will re-enable these login options.
